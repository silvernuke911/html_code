Would my love prevail, perhaps?\nThat I have no idea, but I have leared to automate my fuckass language from when I was dumb and 16, which is worth it, I suppose. I am net worth 500 Pesos, so no one really cares.\nThey say it is the duty of the conquered to wallow upon their master's whims, which is saddening, definitely, but something people really find no problem addressing. What with life being fucked and all that shit. All I pray now is that I am united with my dear Navi, who I have not seen for 3 moons now. What a shame.\n Is it possible to automate text this way? Is it even fair, and I suppose not. We fit all that we can in such a small space that it is hardly wondrous to observe.\n\n What is 1+1? That is the question, is it not, to find symbold such that 1+1=2, or such and so other combinations of the 10 other or 125 other fucking combinations. What is it, then; We know not how we serve, but how to serve."
